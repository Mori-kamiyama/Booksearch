# Project Status

## 2026-06-05

- DB confidence update was tested with the full/hidden book image pair.
- Observed behavior matched the expected shape: 43 total books, 10 hidden, 32 books seen twice and 10 seen once in the confidence test run.
- AWS Lambda/DynamoDB integration and a small frontend for shelf candidates were implemented before cleanup.
- Generated artifacts and raw local outputs were removed from the working tree.
- Git history rewrite attempt accidentally removed tracked files; recovery was performed from local Claude/Codex logs and file-history backups.
